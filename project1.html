        <p class="description">
            This project aimed to analyze the financial profiles of small business owners and non-business owners, identify
            patterns, and create clusters of small business owners with similar financial characteristics. The study involved exploratory 
            data analysis, dimensionality reduction, and clustering using machine learning techniques.

                        The provided visualizations collectively offer key insights 
                        into the dynamics of business ownership, income distribution, 
                        household finances, and demographics. The first chart reveals 
                        significant disparity in income distribution, with business 
                        owners overwhelmingly dominating the highest income category, 
                        while non-business owners are prevalent in lower income categories.  
                        The second plot shows the relationship between home value and 
                        household debt, where most households are clustered in the lower 
                        ranges of both variables, indicating modest home values and debt 
                        levels for the majority. However, a few outliers with high home 
                        values and debt suggest financial behaviors or wealth disparities in 
                        specific households. The third chart illustrates the age distribution 
                        of small business owners, showing that the majority are between 40 and 
                        60 years old, peaking around age 50. This suggests that mid-career individuals, 
                        likely due to accumulated experience and financial resources, are most 
                        inclined to own businesses, with significantly fewer younger owners and 
                        a decline in ownership among individuals over 70 years old.
