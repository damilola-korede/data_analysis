        <p class="description">
            The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning
            model to predict whether a company would go bankrupt based 
            on financial indicators. The project involved preprocessing 
            an imbalanced dataset, training a model, and evaluating its 
            performance to achieve high accuracy and reliability.

                Target Variable: Bankrupt? (binary classification: 1 for bankruptcy, 0 for no bankruptcy).
                Features: Financial attributes of companies such as debt ratio, working capital, and profitability
                metrics.
                Imbalance: The dataset exhibited class imbalance, with significantly more non-bankrupt companies 
                than bankrupt ones.

                        The model demonstrates strong performance in identifying 
                        non-bankrupt companies, achieving a very high true negative count 
                        of 1302 and only a small number of false positives (11). This 
                        indicates a low false positive rate, making it highly reliable 
                        in classifying companies that are not bankrupt. However, the model
                         struggles with accurately identifying bankrupt companies, as 
                         evidenced by a low true positive count of 16 and a relatively 
                         high false negative count of 35
