            Project Overview
        </p>

        <p class="description">
            This project aimed to evaluate how access to credit influences 
            the food security status of women rice farmers in Ekiti State, Nigeria. 
            By analyzing data from 46 farmers, the study found that access to credit 
            significantly improved food security by enabling farmers to invest in inputs 
            like seeds, fertilizers, and labor.

                SPSS was used for running probit regression to assess the 
                impact of credit access on food security, while Excel was employed 
                for organizing data and running descriptive statistics. The Food Security 
                Index was calculated using expenditure-based methods.

                <p class="description">
                    I applied probit regression to identify the factors influencing 
                    food security, with credit access being a significant variable. 
                    The Food Security Index was computed based on the household food 
                    expenditure method, with a cutoff value to determine food-secure and 
                    food-insecure households. Budgetary analysis provided insights into 
                    the profitability of rice farming among credit-accessing farmers.

                    <p class="description">
                        The probit regression analysis showed that credit access 
                        significantly increased the likelihood of food security among 
                        the women rice farmers, with a positive coefficient of 0.523 (p < 0.05). 
                        The food security index revealed that 42.1% of women with credit access 
                        were food secure compared to only 11.5% of those without credit access. 
                        These results highlight the crucial role of financial inclusion in enhancing 
                        food security.
