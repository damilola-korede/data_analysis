          In many retail businesses, large volumes of sales data exist, but decision-makers 
          still struggle to answer simple questions: Are we truly profitable? Which products 
          and suppliers drive value? When do we actually make money? This project was built 
          to bridge that gap. Using Power BI, I transformed raw transactional sales data into a 
          clear, executive-ready dashboard that tells the story of revenue growth, cost control, 
          and profitability across products, categories, and suppliers.

            Microsoft Power BI was the sole software used for the execution of this project,
            data cleaning and pre processing was done in power query. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
            was applied to create dynamic measures such as revenue, profit, and profit margin.

                      The dataset consisted of detailed sales records including product information, 
                      quantities sold, unit prices, cost prices, dates, and suppliers. Before any analysis could begin,
                      the data was cleaned and standardized in Power Query to ensure consistent data types, accurate 
                      numeric values, and reliable date fields.
                      From there, I modeled the data in Power BI using a structured approach that allows metrics to be analyzed
                      by time, category, product, and supplier.

                    <p class="description">
                      To move beyond raw numbers, I created core business metrics using DAX. 
                      These measures form the backbone of the dashboard and ensure that all visuals
                      remain consistent and accurate as filters are applied.
                        
                      
                      Total Revenue was calculated as:
                      Total_revenue = SUMX(Sheet1,Sheet1[Unit Price]*Sheet1[Quantity])
                      
                    
                      Total Cost was defined as:
                      Total_cost = SUMX(Sheet1,RELATED('Sheet1 (2)'[Cost Price])*Sheet1[Quantity])

                      From these two measures, Profit was derived to reflect true business performance:
                      Profit = [Total_revenue] - [Total_cost]

                      Finally, to assess efficiency rather than just volume, I calculated Profit Margin:
                      Profit_margin = DIVIDE([Profit],[Total_revenue]) 

                      These measures automatically respond to slicers such as date, category, or supplier, allowing
                      stakeholders to view profitability from multiple angles without recalculating figures manually.

                      At the top of the dashboard, three KPI cards immediately establish context. The business has generated ₦2M
                      in total revenue, with ₦552K in profit, resulting in a 36% profit margin. This snapshot alone answers the 
                      most critical executive question: Are we making money?
                      When revenue is broken down by product category, a clearer picture emerges. Electronics dominate total revenue,
                      followed by home appliances, while accessories contribute a smaller share. This immediately highlights where the
                      business should focus its marketing efforts and inventory investments.
                      Profitability by supplier adds another critical layer to the story. While several suppliers contribute positively,
                      a small number clearly stand out as top profit drivers. This insight is particularly valuable for procurement teams,
                      as it supports data-backed supplier negotiations and long-term partnership decisions.
